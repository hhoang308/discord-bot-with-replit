# DONT RUN IT YET THERE ARE A FEW THINGS YOU NEED TO DO FIRST (Instructions Below)

### FYI the node version shown in the console is incorrect, you can ignore it. (The actual discord.js and node.js versions are in the package.json file)

## Step One: 
Go to the developer portal, go to the bot tab, and under Privileged Gateway Intents, make sure Presence Intent, Server Members Intent, and Message Content Intent, are all turned on. (I would also copy the bot token while you're on that page)

## Step 2:
Go to the replit sidebar (on the left side of this webpage), click the lock icon (It's called "Secrets (Environment Variables)" --- Once you are in that tab, in the "key" box put the word "TOKEN" **HAS TO BE ALL CAPS** (dont include the quotes) ------- In the "value" box, paste your discord bot token, then click on: "Add new secret".

## Step 3:
Run the program once to make sure that it works (if it's successful you should see in the Console: "YourBotName#XXXX is online!", along with the actual node version (I believe it's nodeJS v16.13.0 or maybe a newer version)
